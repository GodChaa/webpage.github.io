                            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Garnet</strong>. I am 17 years old and currently in my senior year at <strong>Montfort College</strong>. I have a strong passion for information technology and software engineering.</p>
                            <p>As someone who loves learning and continuously developing new skills, I have studied and practiced programming both inside and outside of the classroom. I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, as well as in using SQL for database management.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work on a <strong>Smart Farming IoT project</strong>, which has helped me gain hands-on experience in connecting devices over a network and collecting data from various sensors. These include the LM393 light sensor and the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.</p>
                            <p>Studying software engineering at the <strong>College of Media, Arts, and Technology</strong> will help me build on my skills and gain experience that will prepare me to become a technology developer who can make a positive impact on society.</p>
